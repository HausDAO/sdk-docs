# Helm Charts

[Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) are a packaging tool for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for containers. It allows the definition of the infrastructure set-up in a configuration file. Helm contains our definitions and allows for specific configurations to replicate and customize infrastructure settings.

To see the most recent infrastructure configuration view [`Chart.yaml`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/blob/develop/libs/infra-chart/daohaus/Chart.yaml) in the `daohaus-monorepo`.
