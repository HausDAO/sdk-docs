# Moloch v3 Contracts

DAOhaus apps are built on top of the Moloch DAO framework. We seek to slay the God of Coordination Failure.

Moloch v3 is a minimal yet composable DAO template continuing work from the Moloch, Minion and Compound frameworks making it easier for people to combine and command crypto assets with intuitive membership games. Moloch v3 is a governance layer sitting on top of a multisig treasury. It uses the Gnosis Zodiac standards to interface with the treasury.

v3 introduced a set of powerful new features:

- Shares and loot are ERC-20 tokens
- Shamans are external contracts with permissions in the DAO
- Governance parameters are adjustable with proposals

Details about Moloch v3 are available in the [contract documentation](https://baal-docs.vercel.app/).
