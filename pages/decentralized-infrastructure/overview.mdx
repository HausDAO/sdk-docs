# Decentralized Infrastructure

Our philosophy is to provide infrastructure that avoids centralization, to allow users to run the same infrastructure and even host their own data processing features. If someone wanted to fork DAOhaus and change something in the build, they should easily be able to recreate the entire DAOhaus experience, including our centralized infrastructure. We accomplish this through Helm Charts.

You probably only care about this information if you are interested in setting up your own decentralized infrastructure.
