# Decentralized Infrastructure

Our philosophy is to provide infrastructure that avoids centralization, allowing users to run the same infrastructure and even host their own data processing features. If someone wanted to fork DAOhaus and change something in the build, they should easily be able to recreate and customize the entire DAOhaus experience, including our centralized infrastructure. We accomplish this through Helm Charts.

Decentralized infrastructure is one of the toughest problems within the application space. Once you introduce centralized points you lose transparency and interoperability. Centralizing also increases security requirements. We are working towards a decentralized solution as the basis for a trusted network of data.

This information in this section is relevant if you are interested in setting up your own decentralized infrastructure. We encourage individuals and teams to use this foundation to build their own versions of our infrastructure, features and apps. If DAOhaus went away the coordination technology can survive.
