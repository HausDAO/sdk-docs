# Ceramic Node

[Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) allows for decentralized data storage. We use Ceramic for storing data to compute and process using [Jobs](jobs). The data output lives in decentralized Ceramic nodes.

Ceramic currently runs a document style node requiring [IPFS](https://infura.io/product/ipfs). To learn more about Ceramic nodes check out [Running Ceramic in production](https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/nodes/).

If you want to recreate the DAOhaus front-end, you can pull calculated data from our Ceramic infrastructure, which is publicly accessible.

Ceramic charts in the [`daohaus-monorepo`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/tree/develop/libs/infra-chart/ceramic).

## Definitions

If you are interested in creating apps using the data from our platform you can point to the Ceramic definitions.

- How?
