# Ceramic Node

Ceramic has a document style node, which is what we utilize. The node requires an IPFS node running behind it, as you will find in the repo. Check out [Ceramic's Node docs](https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/nodes/) if you are interested in learning more. We use Ceramic to store our data. We compute and process this data with Jobs. The final end product data lives in decentralized Ceramic nodes.

If you wanted to recreate DAOhaus entirely, you could setup your infrastructure through [Helm Charts](https://hackmd.io/@daohaus/V3Docs-HelmCharts). If you only wanted to recreate DAOhaus' frontend, you could pull calculated data from our Ceramic infrastructure, which is publicly accessible.
