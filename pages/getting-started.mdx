# Getting Started

Our monorepos use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as a build system and for scaffolding. If this your first time using Nx, you'll have to install it globally on your system:
`npm install -g nx`

Here is a basic guide. Each package README (and `project.json`) will have more details about commands within each package.

```bash

`git clone git@github.com:HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo.git` or `git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo.git`

# clone the entire monorepo at the top level on the develop branch

`yarn`
# run yarn to install all of the packages and dependencies

```

Replaced t-he https link with e2t's update. This section is not particularly instructional. It really needs to be elaborated to describe what to do and why

Need instructions on going into the directory before the prompt to install Yarn.

Need a walkthrough of the structure of the repo. Add the V3 Dependencies diagram? Like an overview or a sitemap for navigating the repo. Where's the MAP dawg?
--->

Once cloned and everything is installed, you'll be able to run each package! Package-level commands are run with `nx run` instead of `yarn` -- this may be new if you're used to working in a different repo structure. Each package has similar command structure, but some packages have additional commands.

The package-level commands can be found in each package's `project.json`.

```bash

# run a specific package locally (usually on localhost:3000)
# such as the component library or frontend applications

nx run app-name:serve

# example to run the Hub app:

nx run hub-app:serve

# lint a specific package

nx run app-name:lint

# example to lint the Hub app:

nx run hub-app:lint

# build a specific package:

nx run app-name:build

# example to build the Hub app:

nx run hub-app:build

```

# Nx Generators

We've created _generators_ that leverage `nx` with predetermined option flags.

### React App

Our stack uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our React build tool. This generator will scaffold a new React app, such as a frontend app, using `vite` and `styled-components`.

`nx g @nxext/react:application --name <name of app> --pascalCaseFiles true --routing true --style styled-components`

TypeScript is enabled and included by default.

### React Library

Our stack uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our React build tool. This generator will scaffold a new React library (such as a component library) with `vite` and `styled-components`.

- `nx g @nxext/react:library --name here --importPath @daohaus/<package_name> --buildable true --publishable true --style styled-components`

TypeScript is enabled and included by default.

Notes: - use the `--publishable` flag for external libraries - use the `--buildable` flag for internal libraries

### TypeScript Library

- `nx g @nrwl/js:lib <lib_name> --importPath @daohaus/<package_name> --publishable true`

Notes: - use the `--publishable` flag for external libraries - use the `--buildable` flag for internal libraries

### Node Application

- `nx g @nrwl/node:application <app_name>`

### Lamdba Application

- `nx generate @ns3/nx-serverless:app <name> --plugin @ns3/nx-serverless/plugin`

### Common Issues

- Sometimes vite applications will have trouble finding dependencies with a depth greater than 1. To resolve this create a custom vite config like the one mentioned in [this](https://github.com/aleclarson/vite-tsconfig-paths/issues/12#issuecomment-1081160667) issue, and update the build and serve commands in the project.json to point to the new vite config path. Now your issues should be resolved.

# Towards the Builder Personna

- Interfacing through NPM not through Github
  - Need to know what NPM packages we have on offer
  - Why they would want to install them
  - What components they can pull in, what functions they can call, what they can do with those packages
