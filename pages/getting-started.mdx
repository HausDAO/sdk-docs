# Getting Started

Our monorepos use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as a build system and for scaffolding. If this your first time using Nx, you'll have to install it globally on your system:
`npm install -g nx`

Here is a basic guide. Each package README (and `project.json`) will have more details about commands within each package.

```bash

`git clone git@github.com:HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo.git` or `git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo.git`

# clone the entire monorepo at the top level on the develop branch

`yarn`
# run yarn to install all of the packages and dependencies

```

## Features

We're using a monorepo to manage our libraries and apps. Each library can be installed via `npm` for use in an external app or tool that you're building.

Our libraries in the libs folder are structured to be consumed by our apps as well as used by external developers using our tooling.

**Utility Libraries**
These are libraries that are used to provide foundational utility that can be composed and integrated into applications.

- DAO Data SDK
- Component Library

**Feature Libraries**
These compose together other libraries such as the DAO Data SDK and the Component Library to create "smart components" that can be integrated into applications.

- DAOhaus Connect
- Tx Builder
- Form Builder
