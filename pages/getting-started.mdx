# Getting Started

The _DAOhaus Toolbox_ is a modular, composable set of libraries that can be integrated into your own projects. It is a collection of tools that can be used to extend the DAOhaus functionality or to integrate DAOhaus functionality into an existing project.

DAOhaus v3 represents a move toward increased decentralization in our infrastructure and tooling. As we identified the core elements in each area of v3's functionality, we began building the libraries and tooling to support it. We then used these libraries and tools in creating our own DAOhaus v3 applications.

When we made the decision for DAOhaus v3 to be much more composable and modular, we also decided that we would open source the tooling that we create in making v3. Every library and utility contained in the _DAOhaus Toolbox_ is used in our own DAOhaus v3 applications. We've made continual refinements and improvements along the way as we discover them in our own use cases.

There is a wide range of possibilities for communities and developers using our tooling. If you're looking to build a tool that extends DAOhaus functionality you can integrate our **Utility Libraries**. As a developer, you can choose if you want to use our component library and theming or if you'd like to build your own UI and styles and leverage our data libraries to query and interact with a user's DAOs.

We've also open sourced our _Feature Libraries_ which are typically a combination of UI and data elements to create specific functionality such as in _DAOhaus Connect_.

## Features

We're using a monorepo to manage our libraries and apps. Each library can be installed via `npm` for use in an external app or tool that you're building.

Our libraries in the libs folder are structured to be consumed by our apps as well as used by external developers using our tooling.

**Utility Libraries**
These are libraries that are used to provide foundational utility that can be composed and integrated into applications.

- DAO Data SDK
- Component Library

**Feature Libraries**
These compose together other libraries such as the DAO Data SDK and the Component Library to create "smart components" that can be integrated into applications.

- DAOhaus Connect
- Tx Builder
- Form Builder

Each of these libraries can be found in our [DAOhaus v3 Monorepo](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo) in the `/libs` folder and are included in the Toolbox documentation.
