# Introduction

The primary motivation of the DAOhaus development kit is to provide a set of tools that make it wasy to read and write the data from our decentralized infrastructure. The contracts write directly to the blockchain, with subgraphs on top of the contracts that make the data more query-able, and a set of additional layers to the infrastructure like Ceramic Nodes that hold data related to addresses, Jobs, and Helm Charts which both cache data from the blockchain to make it easy for our applications to read. Our SDK provides a set of utilities to pull data from this infrastructure and make it beautifully accessible in your applications.
