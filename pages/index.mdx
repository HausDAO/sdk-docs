# Introduction

For Web3 developers who are frustrated building a complicated stack, DAO Toolbox is a set of resources allowing you to focus on creating value for your community. Unlike spending months wiring up the backend, we have assembled a [Decentralized Infrastructure](./decentralized-infrastructure/overview) and [Software Development Kit](./sdk/overview) to boostrap DAO applications.

- [Software Development Kit](./sdk/overview)
- [Decentralized Infrastructure](./decentralized-infrastructure/overview)

Whether you are building a stand alone project or extending [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/) functionality, DAO Toolbox makes it easier to read and write DAO data. We are hoping our years of experience figuring this stuff out saves you time and helps you prioiritize what matters.

The [contracts](./decentralized-infrastructure/contracts) write directly to the blockchain, with [subgraphs](./decentralized-infrastructure/subgraphs/overview) making the data easier to query. We package the infrastruture with [Helm Charts](./decentralized-infrastructure/helm-charts) encouraging recreation and customization of the entire [DAOhaus App](https://app.daohaus.club/) experience. On-chain and subgraph data is processed and transformed into formats that are easier to consume with [jobs](./decentralized-infrastructure/jobs). Data output is stored in decentralized [Ceramic nodes](./decentralized-infrastructure/ceramic-node). We hope this set of utilities pulling from that base layer makes it more accessible for applications built on top.

We have published the packages in our [SDK](./sdk/overview) to NPM. These include the [Common Utilities](./sdk/utilities/common-utilities/overview) helpers used throughout the different libraries and the [Contract Utilities](./sdk/utilities/contract-utilities/overview) for making function calls and writing data to the contracts. Querying is simplified with the [DAO Data](./sdk/data/overview) library wrapping the subgraphs. Additionally, we have included our component library in the [UI](./sdk/ui/overview) package and added some slick builders for common features to help you build DAO apps faster.

These tools are our gift to the Ethereum ecosystem. DAOs are hard. We have spent years meditating, building, failing and iterating on the process and tools for slaying [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). As a community we can become stronger and encourage you to contribute to this project. Please report bugs, request features and provide feedback to help improve this DAO Toolbox. Everything here is open-source. The software development kit and decentralized infrastructure is in the [`daohaus-monorepo`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/) and the documentation is in the [`sdk-docs`](https://github.com/HausDAO/sdk-docs) repo on GitHub.

We would also love to have you join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/daohaus)!
