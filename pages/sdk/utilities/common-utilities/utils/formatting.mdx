# [`formatting.ts`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/blob/develop/libs/common-utilities/src/utils/formatting.ts)

The code consists of several helper functions designed to make working with the `ethers` library easier. The first function, `truncateAddress`, takes an address string and returns a truncated version of it. The second function, `charLimit`, takes a string and a limit and returns a truncated version of the string if it is longer than the limit. The third function, `handlePluralNoun`, takes a noun and a count and returns the singular or plural form of the noun depending on the count. The fourth function, `fromWei`, takes an amount string and returns a string representation of it in `ethers`. The fifth function, `isJSON`, takes an object and returns `true` if it is a JSON string, and `false` otherwise.
