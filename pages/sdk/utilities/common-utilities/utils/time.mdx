# [`time.ts`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/blob/develop/libs/common-utilities/src/utils/time.ts)

The code defines a series of functions related to time. The constant `conversionFns`, converts days, hours, minutes, and seconds into seconds. The function, `toSeconds`, converts a given amount of time in a given unit into seconds. The second function, `unixTimeInSeconds`, returns the current time in Unix time (i.e. the number of seconds since January 1, 1970). The third function, `calcExpiry`, calculates when a given duration will expire. The final function, `formatPeriods`, formats a given duration into a more human-readable form.
