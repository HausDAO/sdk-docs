# Common Utilities

Common utilities are helpers used throughout the different libraries. They are divided into Constants, Content, Types and Utils.

## Constants

Constants are the variables that never change. They include [`chainData`](./constants/chain-data), [`contracts`](./constants/contracts), [`endpoints`](./constants/endpoints), [`posterTags`](./constants/poster-tags) and [`proposals`](./constants/proposals).

## Content

Content includes the information contained in the app's [`form`](./content/form) and the tooltip [`info`](./content/info).

## Types

Common types are used across all apps. They include [`contract`](./types/contract), [`general`](./types/general), [`keychains`](./types/keychains), [`legoTypes`](./types/lego-types) and [`react`](./types/react).

## Utils

Utilities are functions you can pull into your app to accomplish all kinds of common actions, such as:

- [`dates`](./utils/dates) allow you to format dates and periods
- [`encoding`](./utils/encoding) helps encode values and functions and get a nonce
- [`explorer`](./utils/explorer) allows you to generate links to block explorers
- [`formatting`](./utils/formatting) help you trunctate addresses, set character limits, handle plural nouns, and convert from Wei
- [`general`](./utils/general) allows you to calculate voting power percentage and convert to now in seconds
- [`gnosis`](./utils/gnosis) helps you generate a link to a Gnosis safe
- [`object`](./utils/object) allows you to omit an object and and fields
- [`time`](./utils/time) helps you with a conversion object and functions to convert to seconds and format periods
- [`typeguards`](./utils/typeguards) allows you to validate types with functions
- [`units`](./utils/units) helps you with functions, types, interfaces and contstants
- [`validation`](./utils/validation) allows you to validate fields and error messages
