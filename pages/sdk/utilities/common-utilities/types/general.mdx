# [`general.ts`](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/blob/develop/libs/common-utilities/src/types/general.ts)

Exports types that can be used to type other values. The first type, `Noun`, is a type that describes a singular and plural form of a word. The second type, `ArbitraryState`, is a type that describes an object with any number of key-value pairs. The third type, `RequireAtLeastOne`, is a type that describes an object that must have at least one of the specified keys. The fourth type, `RequireOnlyOne`, is a type that describes an object that must have exactly one of the specified keys. The fifth type, `EthAddress`, is a type that describes an Ethereum address. The sixth and final type, `ValueOf`, is a utility type that gets the value of a given type.
