# Tx Builder

This React-specific feature allows your application to easily make transactions with all the JavaScript app lifecycle functions baked-in to trigger error and success messages, along with other cool features. Transaction Builder demonstrates the power of our [Write DAO Data](https://hackmd.io/@daohaus/V3Docs-WriteDAOData) utilities when paired with the React [Component Library](https://hackmd.io/@daohaus/V3Docs-ComponentLibraryUI) to help users build transactions. Transactions are at the core of our platform, so we designed this library to provide helper utilities for this purpose. This library is an evolution of the patterns utilized in DAOhaus v2.

The core element is a React Context that bundles together generic transaction calls with subgraph polling within the function. This provides lifecycle methods that we can use to control UI based on synchronized events from within the React component.


## Installation

When this package is published on `npm` we'll have instructions on how to include it in your apps. If you're using this from inside the monorepo, you can import directly from the package.

The package name for importing is `@daohaus/tx-buiilder-feature`. If you've pulled down the entire monorepo you can reference it via this namespace, such as `import { TXBuilder } from '@daohaus/tx-builder-feature';`.

## Usage

Begin by importing the `TXBuilder` component from the `@daohaus/tx-builder-feature` package at a high-level component, such as `App.tsx`, in your app. This doesn't need to be at the root of your app with other Context Providers.

### TxBuilder

```jsx
// App.tsx
import { TXBuilder } from '@daohaus/tx-builder-feature';
```

Once `TXBuilder` is imported, you can wrap your component with it and pass in the connected user's `provider` and `chainId`, which can come in from DAOhaus Connect.

In this example, `TXBuilder` is used in combination with DAOhaus Connect, where the `provider` and `chainId` are coming from the DAOhaus Connect context and are provided as props to `TXBuilder`:

```jsx
// App.tsx
const { provider, chainId } = useHausConnect();

<TXBuilder provider={provider} chainId={chainId}>
  <YourComponents />
</TXBuilder>;
```

`<TXBuilder />` expects a `provider`, `chainId`, and `children` as props.

### useTxBuilder

Tx Builder exposes useful functionality that you can use throughout your app as well. You can access these by importing `useTxBuilder` from Tx Builder:

```jsx
// Anywhere in your app

`import { useTxBuilder } from '@daohaus/tx-builder-feature';`;

const { fireTransaction } = useTxBuilder();
```

You're then able to utilize the `fireTranscation` function which composes the transation calls and subgraph polling. For a more detailed example, look to the `SummonerForm.tsx` in our [Summon App](../../apps/summon-app/).

## Examples

`TXBuilder` is used in our Summon App. We'll be adding more examples to our documentation as we go!
